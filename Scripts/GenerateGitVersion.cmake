# Computes the FEX build identity (git describe string + 20-byte git hash) and
# writes FEXCore/include/git_version.h.in out to the build tree.
#
# This file is used two ways, and the two uses MUST produce byte-identical
# output or every build will look like the header changed:
#
#   1. include()d from the top-level CMakeLists.txt at configure time. This
#      guarantees the generated header exists before anything compiles, and
#      leaves GIT_DESCRIBE_STRING / GIT_HASH set in the caller's scope for
#      the status messages.
#
#   2. Run via `cmake -P` from the `git_version_header` custom target
#      (FEXCore/CMakeLists.txt) on every build. Configure-time-only detection
#      is not enough: FEXCore/Source/Interface/Core/CodeCache.cpp gates code
#      cache loads on GIT_HASH and on nothing else that tracks the build (the
#      header check is Magic / FormatVersion / FEXVersion / non-zero block
#      count -- no mtime, no path, no size). So after an incremental `ninja`
#      following a JIT source edit, a binary built from new sources would load
#      caches emitted by the previous build, and an A/B measurement across a
#      codegen change silently compares old code against old code.
#
# configure_file() only rewrites its output when the rendered content differs,
# so a no-op build leaves git_version.h's mtime alone and does not cascade a
# rebuild of the nine translation units that include it.
#
