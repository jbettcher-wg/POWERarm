/**
 * @brief The host-page-size startup gate.
 *
 * FEX's guest contract is AT_PAGESZ=4096 and that never changes. What changes
 * with the host kernel is the granularity real mmap/mprotect/munmap demand, and
 * the port that makes that a runtime quantity is staged (docs/PAGE_SIZE_64K_PLAN.md,
 * docs/PAGE_SIZE_64K_EXECUTION.md). Until the guest memory syscalls and mtrack
 * are granule-aware (stages S4/S5), a host page larger than 4096 is not a
 * supported configuration, and the failure modes are silent: deferred signals
 * that never arm and a guest that hangs with no diagnostic.
 *
 * FEX_HOSTPAGEMODE selects what happens on such a host:
 *   abort   (default) - explain and refuse to start.
 *   degrade           - continue, and force SMCChecks=full, which is the
 *                       correctness fallback that does not depend on host-page
 *                       protection granularity. Log the relaxed contract once.
 *   force             - continue, force nothing. For bring-up work.
 *
 * FEX_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED_PAGE_SIZE=1 is kept as an alias for `force`.
 *
 * Written straight to stderr rather than through LogMan on purpose. FEX_SILENTLOG
 * defaults to on and every LogMan path is swallowed when it is; a gate whose whole
 * purpose is to replace a silent hang with an explanation cannot be silenceable by
 * the default logging config.
