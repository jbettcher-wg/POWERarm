// SMC lazy invalidation   (FEX_SMCLAZYINVAL=1)
//
//   As originally written this option traded correctness for speed.  It no
//   longer does by default: FEX_SMCLAZYSCRUB (default 1) closes the
//   same-thread hole -- see "SAME-THREAD SOUNDNESS: THE SCRUB" at the bottom,
//   which supersedes the "ACCEPTED UNSOUNDNESS" section above it.
//   FEX_SMCLAZYSCRUB=0 restores the original unsound-but-faster behaviour and
//   is kept only for A/B measurement.
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// PROBLEM
// -------
// Even with v3 (soft-invalidate + validate-relink, see
// FEXCore/Source/Interface/Core/SMCSoftInvalidate.h) an SMC write fault still
// performs work *inside the signal handler*, on the writer's critical path:
// SoftInvalidateGuestCodeRange takes ThreadCreationMutex plus the exclusive
// CodeInvalidationMutex, walks every CodeBuffer's LookupCache, severs block
// links and moves entries to the retained table.  Measured on POWER8 the whole
// storm cycle is ~22us and the fault + delink + relink portion is ~17us of it;
// removing only the recompile bought +35% on smcstorm/falseshare.  The writer
// wants to get back to storing, and the invalidation it is being charged for
// is not needed until *something* is about to execute.
//
// DESIGN
// ------
//  1. SMC write fault on a PRIVATE tracked code page: record the page in a
//     global dirty-page set, unprotect it (exactly the mprotect legacy does),
//     and invalidate NOTHING.  Return.  The store retries and succeeds, and
//     the writer then runs at native speed -- no further faults on that page
//     until a drain re-arms protection.
//  2. Drain: for each dirty page, ThreadManager::SoftInvalidateGuestCodeRange.
//     That is v3's delink; the retained entries are hash-validated and
//     relinked-or-recompiled lazily at their next dispatch.
//  3. Drain does NOT re-protect.  It does not have to: SoftInvalidateRange
//     erases the page from GuestToHostMap::CodePages, so the next relink
//     (ContextImpl::TryRelinkSoftInvalidatedBlock) or fresh compile
//     (ContextImpl::CompileBlock) sees AddBlockExecutableRange return
//     NewPage==true and calls SyscallHandler::MarkGuestExecutableRange, which
//     is the one and only place mtrack write protection is installed.  So the
//     page becomes protected again exactly when live code reappears on it --
//     the same invariant v3 already relies on.
//  4. Drain points (all gated on an atomic count so an empty set costs one
//     relaxed load and a not-taken branch):
//       a. ContextImpl::CompileBlock, *before* it takes CodeInvalidationMutex
//          shared -- i.e. before any lookup or relink.  Any thread about to
//          run code it has not got in its L1 drains first.
//       b. FEX::HLE::SyscallHandler::HandleSyscall, at entry.
//       c. FEX::HLE::SignalDelegator::HandleGuestSignal, immediately before
//          the guest signal handler frame is built.
//  5. A hard invalidation of a dirty page (guest munmap/mmap-over/mremap/
//     mprotect) drops its record, exactly where FEX_SMCMPROTECTDEFER drops
//     its own: the unconditional InvalidateCodeRangeIfNecessary on those paths
//     is strictly stronger than the drain would have been.  A guest mprotect
//     that grants PROT_EXEC drains the range synchronously before the syscall
//     returns.
//
// HOST PAGES LARGER THAN THE GUEST PAGE   (64K port, stage S4c)
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Step 1's "unprotect it (exactly the mprotect legacy does)" is an mprotect,
// so on a 64K kernel it opens all 16 guest pages of the host granule, not the
// one that faulted. The dirty-page SET stays indexed per GUEST page -- its
// consumer is SoftInvalidateGuestCodeRange, a guest-code quantity, and the
// content hashes it validates against are guest-4K -- but the RECORDING side
// has to cover the granule, or the drain settles page N while N+1..N+15 sit
// unprotected with live blocks on them and nothing left to ever invalidate
// them. That is the soundness rule of design Part 2 section 5 broken through
// the lazy door, and it is a strictly worse hole than the one this option
// knowingly accepts, because no scrub and no cross-poke bounds it.
//
// So the fault path marks every TRACKED guest page of the granule dirty, not
// just the faulting one (SyscallsSMCTracking.cpp, the SMCLazyInvalActive
// branch). Untracked siblings are skipped: no protection of ours was on them
// and no block was compiled from them, so a drain would have nothing to do.
//
// The cross-thread arming (FEX_SMCLAZYCROSSPOKE / FEX_SMCLAZYLINK) needs no
// change: it arms the WRITER's InterruptFaultPage through
// InternalThreadState::ProtectInterruptFaultPage, whose mprotect is already
// HostPage::Size() and whose page is its own host-page allocation since stage
// S2 moved it out of the struct and behind a pointer.
//
// The epoch bookkeeping is an OR across the pages marked, so a granule whose
// first dirty page starts the epoch still arms every thread exactly once.
//
// 4K: the loop runs exactly once, on the faulting page. Unchanged.
//
// Requires FEX_SMCSOFTINVALIDATE=1 and FEX_SMCCHECKS=mtrack; with anything
// else the option logs once and stays off.  Off => not one line of this runs
// and behaviour is byte-identical to whatever the other SMC options select.
//
// ACCEPTED UNSOUNDNESS  (FEX_SMCLAZYSCRUB=0 only -- see the scrub section
// below, which is the default and removes the same-thread part of this)
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// v3 is sound because the delink completes inside the SIGSEGV handler, before
// the faulting store is even retired: from the instant the store lands, no
// path reaches the old host code without going through CompileBlock, which
// re-hashes.  This option deletes exactly that guarantee.
//
//   *** A thread can execute a STALE translation of guest code between the ***
//   *** write that modified it and the next drain point.                   ***
//
// What bounds the exposure:
//
//   - This backend has NO block linking in the sense that matters here.  Every
//     block exit re-probes the L1 lookup table (PPC64LE
//     JIT/BranchOps.cpp DEF_OP(ExitFunction) -- verified), so removing a block
//     from lookup is a complete visibility barrier for anything that is not
//     *already running*.  A lazy scheme therefore only exposes blocks whose
//     translation is currently on-stack or hot-looping at the moment of the
//     write, plus L1 hits taken before the next drain.
//   - Cross-thread SMC was ORIGINALLY argued to be unaffected in contract
//     terms: x86 requires the executing processor to serialize (a branch is not
//     enough) before running cross-modified code, and every mechanism a guest
//     uses to do that -- syscall, signal, or dispatching code it has not run
//     before -- was said to be a drain point here.
//
//     *** THAT ARGUMENT IS WRONG IN PRACTICE.  See "CROSS-THREAD SMC" below. ***
//   - Same-thread SMC is where we knowingly stretch the contract.  x86 says a
//     same-thread patch is visible at the next branch; we say it is visible at
//     the next drain point.  Patch -> call is safe whenever the call misses L1
//     (the target was never compiled, or was invalidated by an earlier drain),
//     because the miss lands in CompileBlock and CompileBlock drains first.
//
//   *** THE KNOWN EXPOSURE: same-thread patch-then-call that HITS L1 on an ***
//   *** already-compiled, not-yet-drained block runs the STALE code.       ***
//
//     That is precisely smcstorm's `patchloop` shape (patch an immediate in a
//     tiny stub, then call the stub, in a tight loop with no intervening
//     syscall).  **With FEX_SMCLAZYSCRUB=0, smcstorm/patchloop's checksum may
//     legitimately FAIL.  That is the accepted, expected outcome of turning
//     the scrub off and NOT a bug.**  Any guest doing runtime codegen in that
//     shape (Mono/.NET tiering-up, JS JIT patch points, game scripting VMs)
//     can miscompute or crash in that configuration.
//
//     With the default FEX_SMCLAZYSCRUB=1 this exposure is closed; see
//     "SAME-THREAD SOUNDNESS: THE SCRUB" below.
//
// Nothing here can corrupt FEX itself: soft-invalidation never frees host
// code, so a stale block is stale-but-valid machine code operating on the
// guest's own state, exactly as a legacy in-flight block is.  The damage is
// confined to guest semantics.
//
//
// SAME-THREAD SOUNDNESS: THE SCRUB   (FEX_SMCLAZYSCRUB=1, the default)
// --------------------------------------------------------------------
// x86 only ever promised SMC coherence to the *modifying* processor.  Code
// modified by one logical processor and executed by another is
// "cross-modifying code" and the architecture requires the executing processor
// to perform a serializing operation before running it; a plain branch is not
// enough, on real hardware either.  So lazy invalidation does not have to
// invalidate globally at fault time.  It only has to guarantee:
//
//   *** after a store fault on thread T dirties page P, thread T's NEXT   ***
//   *** dispatch into any block drains the deferred set first.            ***
//
// Other threads may lawfully keep running stale translations until one of
// their own drain points, and every mechanism a guest has for the serializing
// event x86 demands -- a syscall, a signal, or dispatching code it has not run
// before -- IS one of those drain points.
//
// The guarantee is implemented in two halves:
//
//   1. FAULT SIDE.  SyscallsSMCTracking.cpp, in the lazy branch of
//      HandleSegfault, calls Context::ScrubThreadLookupCacheForLazySMC on the
//      faulting thread.  That zeroes THIS thread's entire L1 lookup table
//      (LookupCache::ScrubForLazySMC -- one madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) on the L1
//      mapping, no lock, no allocation, signal-safe) and sets a per-thread
//      "owes a drain" flag inside the same per-thread LookupCache object.
//      A full flush rather than a per-page one: the fault already costs
//      microseconds, and the page->block direction is not indexable from L1
//      without the write lock this handler must not take.
//
//   2. LOOKUP SIDE.  With L1 empty, the thread cannot resolve ANY guest RIP
//      inline: the dispatcher's probe (PPC64Dispatcher.cpp) and every block's
//      inlined exit probe (BranchOps.cpp DEF_OP(ExitFunction)) both miss and
//      branch to PPC64JITCore::ExitFunctionLink.  That function now, BEFORE it
//      takes CodeInvalidationMutex and consults the shared L2/L3, consumes the
//      flag and runs the drain.  Only then does it look anything up -- so the
//      lookup it performs is against a set from which the dirtied page's
//      blocks have already been soft-invalidated, and a patched block
//      re-hashes and recompiles instead of being republished into L1.
//
// Why the L1 flush alone is not enough, and the ordering in (2) is the whole
// point: L2/L3 are shared and were never scrubbed, so an L1 miss that went
// straight to L2 would simply re-publish the stale translation.  The flush
// buys nothing except the guaranteed trip through (2); (2) is where the
// correctness is.
//
// Why this is complete on PPC64LE and not on Arm64: this backend has no block
// linking.  There is no jump thunk, no ExitFunctionLinkData, no return-address
// predictor stack (BranchOps.cpp's DEF_OP(ExitFunction) header says so; the
// backend's non-use of the CallRet stack is noted in JIT/PPC64LE/JIT.cpp).
// Every single block-to-block transfer re-probes L1.  Therefore "L1 is empty"
// really does mean "the next transfer of control leaves translated code".
// Arm64 patches callsites to branch directly between blocks, so the same
// scrub would leave a thread inside a linked chain running stale code; the
// hook exists there for parity but the soundness claim is PPC64LE-only.
// (PPC64LE block linking, when enabled, is normally interlocked OFF by lazy
// invalidation for exactly this reason — unless FEX_SMCLAZYLINK restores the
// guarantee another way; see "LINKING UNDER LAZY" below.)
//
// What the scrub still does NOT cover, by design:
//   - The block the faulting thread is CURRENTLY executing runs to its next
//     exit before the scrub can matter.  Identical to legacy invalidation,
//     which also cannot recall an in-flight block, and handled by the
//     pre-existing single-instruction-block re-execution path at the tail of
//     HandleSegfault for the case where the store hits the current block.
//   - Cross-thread modification with no serializing event on the reader.  Not
//     a regression: x86 does not guarantee that either.
//   - A store that FEX never sees as a fault at all (a page unprotected by an
//     earlier lazy fault and not yet drained can be written repeatedly with no
//     further faults).  That is the amortization the whole option is built on;
//     it is safe because the FIRST such store on that page already scrubbed
//     this thread and left the drain owed, and the debt is only cleared by a
//     drain that soft-invalidates every recorded page.
//
// ===========================================================================
// LINKING UNDER LAZY   (FEX_SMCLAZYLINK=1, default 0)
// --------------------------------------------------------------------
// The scrub's soundness argument above leans on "every block-to-block
// transfer re-probes L1", which is only true with block linking off — so the
// PPC64LE JIT interlocks BlockLinking off whenever lazy invalidation is armed
// (JIT.cpp, BlockLinkingEnabled).  That interlock costs real performance:
// with linking off, EVERY constant-target block exit round-trips
// PPC64JITCore::ExitFunctionLink (measured 7.3% of cycles as the top symbol
// in Unity combat scenes, plus the indirect costs of the probe).
//
// FEX_SMCLAZYLINK lifts the interlock by rebuilding the same-thread guarantee
// on a trap a linked chain CANNOT skip: the deferred-signal fault-page poke.
// Every dispatcher-reachable block EntryPoint begins with a plain `stb` to
// the thread's InterruptFaultPage (EmitSuspendInterruptCheck, emitted for the
// deferred-signal machinery), and linked branches land on block entries — the
// patched `b HostCode` targets exactly the address the dispatcher would have
// dispatched to.  So:
//
//   1. FAULT SIDE (SyscallsSMCTracking.cpp, lazy branch): after the L1 scrub,
//      additionally mprotect the faulting thread's OWN InterruptFaultPage to
//      PROT_NONE.  One page, own thread, same call the signal delegator makes.
//   2. TRAP SIDE (SignalDelegator.cpp, fault-page SIGSEGV branch): on the
//      poke fault, after restoring the page to RW, settle the drain debt
//      (Context::SettleLazySMCDrainIfPending — the same consume-then-drain
//      sequence ExitFunctionLink performs) BEFORE any resume path, including
//      the empty-queue resume.  The deferral machinery tolerates the spurious
//      arming by construction: no queued signals means unprotect-and-return.
//
// The guarantee becomes: after a lazy fault on thread T, T's next block
// ENTRY — reached by dispatcher probe, inlined exit probe, OR a linked
// branch — faults and drains before the entered block's body runs.  Stronger
// in reach than the ExitFunctionLink drain (which still exists and still
// fires when the L1 miss route gets there first; both consume the same
// per-thread flag, idempotently).
//
// Interactions:
//   - Nested-deferral windows (refcount != 0): the poke fault takes the
//     step-over branch and the page STAYS armed; the drain lands at the first
//     poke outside the outermost deferring section.  FEX-internal code inside
//     those sections reaches guest code only through drain points (a)-(c).
//   - The in-flight current block: exactly the scrub's existing carve-out.
// Cost: one mprotect + one extra SIGSEGV per lazy SMC fault, writer thread
// only, on top of a fault path that already costs microseconds.
// ===========================================================================
//
// ===========================================================================
// CROSS-THREAD SMC   (FEX_SMCLAZYCROSSPOKE=1, OPT-IN -- see the field result)
// --------------------------------------------------------------------
// The original design (see "What bounds the exposure" above) claimed lazy
// invalidation changed nothing for cross-thread SMC, because x86 makes a reader
// responsible for executing a serializing event before it may run
// cross-modified code, and every such event was assumed to be a FEX drain
// point.  Field-confirmed 2026-08-25: that is false, and it crashes real
// guests.
//
//   - The serialization real guest JITs use is NOT a syscall.  HotSpot patches
//     nmethods at a safepoint and brings threads to it with thread-local
//     handshakes and polling loads.  A compute-bound Java thread reaches the
//     poll, spins, and resumes entirely inside code FEX has ALREADY compiled:
//     no syscall, no guest signal, no CompileBlock.  It therefore hits none of
//     drain points (a)-(c) and never drains -- indefinitely.
//   - And the stale window is not benign.  HotSpot frees and REUSES code-cache
//     memory, so a translation that starts out as "the previous version of this
//     method" degrades into a translation of unrelated bytes.  Observed:
//     truncated pointers, bogus klass loads, random SIGSEGVs, within ~1-2
//     minutes of `java -XX:+UseZGC` doing ordinary JIT churn (Project Zomboid,
//     and a minimal Churn repro).  FEX_SMCCHECKS=mtrack FEX_SMCSOFTINVALIDATE=1
//     FEX_SMCLAZYINVAL=1 alone reproduces it; LAZYLINK/FILEIMMUTABLE are not
//     needed.
//
// The fix reuses the LAZYLINK trap side, applied to every thread instead of
// just the writer.  On a lazy fault that opens a dirty epoch, the handler walks
// ThreadManager::Threads and, for each thread other than itself:
//
//   1. sets that thread's lazy-drain-pending flag
//      (Context::ArmLazySMCDrainPending -> LookupCache::ArmLazySMCDrainPending),
//      THEN
//   2. mprotects that thread's InterruptFaultPage to PROT_NONE.
//
// Order is load-bearing: a thread that races the mprotect (its poke landed just
// before the page went away) still holds the flag and settles the debt at its
// next ExitFunctionLink or CompileBlock.  No cross-thread cache is written --
// the drain itself soft-invalidates across every thread -- so this is two
// relaxed stores' worth of interference plus one mprotect per thread.
//
// GUARANTEE (narrower than first hoped -- read the field results below):
// after a lazy SMC fault, EVERY thread's drain-pending flag is set and its
// fault page armed, so each thread settles the drain at its next block entry.
// Not at its next syscall, signal, or compile -- its next block entry.  This
// holds with BlockLinking on or off, because the fault-page poke is emitted
// unconditionally at every dispatcher-reachable EntryPoint and linked branches
// target entries.  The delegator's fault-page branch settles the drain for the
// whole lazy mode now, not only under FEX_SMCLAZYLINK, since the thread that
// traps may be an innocent reader.
//
// *** FIELD RESULT 2026-08-25: NOT SUFFICIENT FOR HOTSPOT. ***  On the Churn
// JVM harness the cross-poke arm still failed 3/6 (vs 2/6 without it, 6/6 for
// lazy off) with the same stale-translation crash signatures.  Known residual
// exposures, either of which could account for that:
//   - A multiblock translation's internal loops never cross a block ENTRY, so
//     a thread hot-looping inside one is never poked at all.
//   - A poke-settled thread resumes INTO the body of the (now soft-invalidated)
//     block it was entering, executing it stale once; if that block is the one
//     that was patched, once is enough.
//   - The block a thread is *inside* at fault time runs to its next entry (the
//     same-thread scrub's long-standing carve-out).
// Until these are closed, FEX_SMCLAZYINVAL remains UNSOUND for guests that
// patch code cross-thread and reuse code memory (HotSpot, and by extension any
// tiering JIT).  Run those with FEX_SMCLAZYINVAL=0.  Cross-poke therefore
// defaults OFF (opt-in FEX_SMCLAZYCROSSPOKE=1) until it demonstrably closes
// the hole and its per-epoch cost is measured on a CP2077-class title.
//
// Threads created during an epoch need no arming: a new thread cannot execute
// anything before reaching CompileBlock, which is drain point (a).
//
// Locking: the walk takes ThreadCreationMutex with try_lock
// (ThreadManager::TryForEachThread) because it runs in the SIGSEGV handler and
// must not block.  On failure the fault falls back to a full synchronous drain
// (DrainPoint::CrossPokeFallback) rather than deferring un-armed -- strictly
// stronger, never unsound, just not lazy.
//
// Cost: paid once per dirty EPOCH (the 0 -> non-empty transition of the dirty
// set), not once per store, so a store burst into an already-dirty page pays
// nothing.  Kill switch FEX_SMCLAZYCROSSPOKE=0 restores the old writer-only
// behaviour for A/B; expect guest JITs to crash in that configuration.
// ===========================================================================
//
// Cost model: the scrub is paid once per fault, on the writer, and it is a
// single syscall.  The drain is paid at the writer's next dispatch, and only
// then.  A writer that stores into a page and never re-dispatches (smcstorm's
// falseshare and crossthread shapes) pays the syscall and nothing else, which
// is why lazy's speedup is expected to survive there while patchloop -- which
// re-dispatches into the page it just wrote, every iteration, and is exactly
// the case that requires the drain -- becomes correct.
//
// POWER8: no codegen is involved.  Pure C++ runtime code.
