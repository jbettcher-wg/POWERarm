/**
 * @brief The host address ranges a 64-bit guest must never be allowed to
 *        replace, unmap or reprotect.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (ppc64le-specific, measured):
 *
 * FEX and the guest share one address space. For a 64-bit guest,
 * SyscallHandler::GuestMmap forwards the guest's mmap straight to the host
 * kernel with the guest's flags intact, so a guest `mmap(MAP_FIXED)` destroys
 * whatever was at that address -- including FEX's own text.
 *
 * On ppc64le, `ELF_ET_DYN_BASE` is 0x1'0000'0000 (arch/powerpc/include/asm/
 * elf.h), so the kernel places FEX's PIE image at 4 GiB + up to 1 GiB of
 * randomisation, i.e. somewhere in [0x1'0000'0000, 0x1'4000'0000). The top of
 * that window is 0x1'4000'0000 -- which is the default `ImageBase` of every
 * 64-bit Windows PE, and the address Wine's `wine64-preloader` reserves with an
 * unconditional
 *
 *     mmap(0x140000000, SizeOfImage, PROT_NONE,
 *          MAP_FIXED|MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_NORESERVE, -1, 0)
 *
 * for every PE process it starts. When FEX's ~7.3 MiB image lands in the top
 * 7.3 MiB of the ASLR window (p ~ 0.68% per exec), that reservation lands on
 * FEX's own code or .bss and the emulator dies at the next call into the
 * clobbered range -- typically with a SIGSEGV somewhere deep in FEXCore that
 * looks like a use-after-free but is an instruction fetch from a PROT_NONE
 * page.
 *
 * On arm64 and x86-64 hosts `ELF_ET_DYN_BASE` is ~0x5555'5555'4000 /
 * 2*TASK_SIZE/3, nowhere near a PE image base, which is why upstream FEX has
 * never needed this.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *
 * SnapshotSelf() is called once, after FEX's own allocator is up and *before*
 * any guest memory is mapped, and records every mapping that exists at that
 * moment: FEX's image (text, rodata, data, bss), the sbrk guard page, the host
 * libraries, the host stack, the vdso, and FEX's stolen allocator regions.
 * Everything recorded is host-private by construction -- the guest did not
 * exist yet -- so refusing a guest request that would destroy one of them can
 * never refuse something the guest legitimately owns.
 *
 * The guest is told "no" the same way the kernel would tell it "no", and the
 * failure is one Wine already handles: `preloader: Warning: failed to reserve
 * range ...`, after which ntdll relocates the image.
 *
 * SCOPE / KNOWN GAPS (deliberate, see docs/fex-teardown-crash.md):
 *  - Only mappings that exist at snapshot time are protected. Host allocations
 *    made later (JIT CodeBuffers, per-thread LookupCache tables, rpmalloc
 *    arenas) are not, unless registered through Add(). They land in the host
 *    mmap arena at 0x3fff'xxxx'xxxx, which no Wine PE base targets.
 *  - Only MAP_FIXED-class requests are checked. Without MAP_FIXED the kernel
 *    never places a mapping over an existing one, so there is nothing to guard.
