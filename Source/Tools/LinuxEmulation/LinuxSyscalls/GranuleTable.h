/**
 * @brief The granule table (docs/PAGE_SIZE_64K_PLAN.md Part 2 §2).
 *
 * FEX hands the guest AT_PAGESZ=4096 unconditionally, so the guest places
 * MAP_FIXED mappings, arms guard pages and unmaps ranges on 4096-byte
 * boundaries. A host kernel whose page is larger cannot represent that: on
 * ppc64le/64K, one host page -- a "granule" -- covers 16 guest pages and the
 * kernel carries exactly one protection for all of them.
 *
 * This table is the fiction that bridges the two. It records
 *
 *   - per guest 4K page, whether it is live and the protection the guest
 *     INTENDED for it, and
 *   - per host granule, the protection FEX actually MATERIALISED with the
 *     kernel.
 *
 * INVARIANT (AssertInvariant(), and checked at every materialisation):
 *
 *     HostProt(granule) == Union(IntendedProt(p) : p in granule, p live)
 *                          & ~(PROT_WRITE if SMC tracking has the granule armed)
 *
 * The armed state is read from the SMC granule table (SMCHostGranule.h); for a
 * granule SMC tracking has ever armed, HostProt is treated as a hint only,
 * because mtrack's own mprotects move the kernel's protection behind it.
 *
 * "Union" is the most permissive combination: nothing the guest believes
 * writable may ever fault for granularity reasons. The consequence -- a
 * protection STRICTER than the granule union is tracked but not enforced -- is
 * the permissive tier, whose correctness envelope is PAGE_SIZE_64K_PLAN §6.
 * Guard pages the guest arms PROT_NONE inside a live granule therefore appear
 * in this table, and in the synthesised /proc/self/maps, but do not fault.
 *
 * ON A 4K HOST THIS TABLE IS NEVER POPULATED. Every entry point that could
 * reach it is guarded by FEXCore::HostPage::MatchesGuest(), so a 4K build
 * executes byte-identically to the pre-port tree. Active() is the single
 * predicate; the emulation layer tests it once per syscall.
 *
 * LOCKING: the table lives inside VMATracking and is covered by
 * VMATracking::Mutex. Mutating calls require the unique (write) hold; const
 * queries require at least the shared hold. It takes no lock of its own -- a
 * second lock here would invert against the CodeInvalidationMutex ordering the
 * SMC layer depends on.
