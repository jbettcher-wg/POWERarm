  //
  // FEX's own anonymous allocator regions (the 48-bit-bit reservations, the
  // rpmalloc arenas) CAN be released again, and the kernel is then free to hand
  // the same addresses to a plain guest mmap. Wine reserves large areas that
  // way and then MAP_FIXEDs its sections inside them, so protecting a
  // recyclable anonymous region would eventually refuse a request the guest
  // legitimately owns.
  //
  // What is recorded instead is the set of mappings that FEX never releases and
  // the guest can never legitimately obtain:
  //   * every file-backed mapping (FEX's own image, host .so files),
  //   * the kernel's named regions ([heap] -- pinned by
  //     SBRKAllocations::DisableSBRKAllocations -- [stack], [vdso], [vvar]),
  //   * anonymous mappings that begin exactly where one of the above ends,
  //     which is how .bss and the sbrk guard page appear.
