// Instruction-cache publication for freshly written host code, on ppc64le.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL — read before "simplifying" it back to a builtin.
//
// This file replaces `__builtin___clear_cache()`, which on this platform
// performs NO cache maintenance whatsoever. Measured on the AC922, 2026-08-13:
//
//   * gcc 16.1.1  `-O2`: the builtin expands to nothing. A function whose only
//     statement is the builtin compiles to a single `blr`.
//   * clang 22.1.8 `-O2` (this tree's compiler): the builtin lowers to
//     `bl __clear_cache`, which binds to `__clear_cache@GCC_3.0` in
//     /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1. That symbol is 0x24 bytes of prologue and
//     epilogue ending in `blr` — no dcbst, no sync, no icbi, no isync.
//
// POWER's instruction cache is NOT coherent with the data cache. Instructions
// written through the store path (the JIT emitter, a memcpy out of the code
// cache, a relocation patch) sit in the D-cache; the fetch unit reads the
// I-cache. Without explicit maintenance a branch into that memory can execute
// whatever the I-cache last held for the same physical line. Everything
// appeared to work anyway, because the window requires the line to have been
// fetched as *different* code beforehand — which is exactly what a JIT with a
// recycled code buffer eventually does.
//
// The sequence below is the one from Power ISA Book II, "Synchronization
// Requirements for Instruction Storage": for each block, `dcbst` to push the
// stored bytes out to coherent storage; one `sync` to order every dcbst ahead
// of the invalidations; for each block, `icbi` to invalidate the instruction
// cache (broadcast to all processors on this implementation); one `sync` to
// ensure the icbis have been performed; `isync` to discard anything already
// prefetched into this thread's pipeline.
//
// Residual, unchanged and inherent: a thread ALREADY executing inside the
// modified range does not itself execute the `isync`, so it may retire the old
// instruction. x86 says the same thing about cross-modifying code without a
// serialising instruction on the executing processor. Callers that patch live
// code (the block linker/delinker, SMC backpatch) are written so that both the
// old and the new word are a correct-behaviour path.

/**
 * @brief Cache block size in bytes to stride the dcbst/icbi loops by.
 *
 * Queried from the auxiliary vector rather than assumed: `dcbst` and `icbi`
 * each operate on one block of their respective cache, and the two sizes are
 * not architecturally required to match. Striding by the SMALLER of the two is
 * the only value that is guaranteed to touch every block of both caches.
 *
 * POWER8/POWER9 report 128 for both. A stride smaller than the true block size
 * is merely redundant work (the extra dcbst/icbi hit blocks already covered),
 * never incorrect, so a missing or nonsensical auxv value falls back to 32 —
 * the smallest block size any PowerPC implementation has used.
 *
 * SIGNAL SAFETY — why this is not a `static const size_t X = f();`.
 * FlushICacheRange is reachable from inside a SIGSEGV handler: the SMC store
 * backpatcher rewrites a faulting store instruction from HandleSegfault
 * (LinuxSyscalls/SyscallsSMCTracking.cpp). A function-local static with a
 * dynamic initialiser emits a __cxa_guard_acquire/release pair, and a signal
 * taken on the same thread while that guard is held re-enters it — recursive
 * initialisation, which aborts or deadlocks. A constant-initialised
 * std::atomic emits no guard at all; the worst case is two threads both
 * computing the same value and storing it, which is harmless.
 *
 * The `getauxval` calls themselves are not on that path in practice — the
 * first flush in any process is PPC64Dispatcher's constructor, from
 * ContextImpl::InitCore, before any guest code runs and therefore before any
 * SMC fault can be taken. Even if one did land there, glibc's getauxval for a
 * non-HWCAP tag is a walk of the auxv array saved at startup: no lock, no
 * allocation, nothing that a signal can interrupt unsafely.
