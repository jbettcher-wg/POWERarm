// SMC Idea 3: sub-page code-granule bitmap
// ===========================================================================
//
// PROBLEM
// -------
// Every SMC store fast path has to answer one question before it may emulate a
// guest store instead of invalidating: "does [EA, EA+Width) overlap the guest
// source bytes of any COMPILED block?"  Today that question is answered by
// GuestToHostMap::RangeOverlapsCompiledCode, which
//   * takes the lookup-cache read lock,
//   * walks the std::map<page, vector<entry>> CodePages index,
//   * hash-looks-up every entry in BlockList, and
//   * chases BlockBegin -> JITCodeHeader -> JITCodeTail for each one.
//
// Measured on op4k with FEX_SMCSTOREBACKPATCH=1 running smcstorm/falseshare:
// the workload runs *correctly* but at 2250 stores/s, and perf attributes 55%
// of all CPU to RangeOverlapsCompiledCode + its LookupCache wrapper (~400us per
// call, dominated by the map walk under the lock).  The pwrite it gates is 3%.
// The same walk sits on the v1 SIGSEGV fast path in SyscallsSMCTracking.cpp.
//
// DESIGN
// ------
// A side structure that answers the *negative* of that question in a handful of
// loads and no lock:
//
//   one bit per 64-byte guest granule; 64 granules per 4KiB page; therefore
//   exactly one uint64_t per guest page.
//
// A bit is SET if some compiled block's guest source bytes (conservatively)
// live in that granule.  The structure is allowed FALSE POSITIVES (a set bit
// with no code behind it) and must never produce a FALSE NEGATIVE (a clear bit
// over live code).  Readers therefore use it only as a fast "provably clear"
// gate: clear => take the store-emulation fast path; anything else => fall
// through to the existing authoritative, locked query, whose result is final.
// If the feature is off, or the address is outside the tracked VA range, or the
// leaf was never allocated because the page never held code, the answer is
// simply "not provably clear" and the old path runs unchanged.
//
// STORAGE
// -------
// Sparse three-level radix over a 48-bit guest VA (FEX's 64-bit guests live in
// the low 47 bits; 32-bit guests occupy the first L0 slot).  Hashing was
// rejected: a hash collision makes two unrelated pages share a leaf, and the
// page-granular CLEAR below would then clear a live page's bits -- a false
// negative, i.e. silent guest corruption.  The radix aliases nothing.
//
//   Addr bits [47:35] -> L0 index (8192 entries, 64KiB, allocated once)
//   Addr bits [34:22] -> L1 index (8192 entries, 64KiB per node, 32GiB reach)
//   Addr bits [21:12] -> leaf index (1024 words, 8KiB per leaf, 4MiB reach)
//   Addr bits [11:6]  -> bit within the page's uint64_t
//
// A game mapping 2-4GiB of code pages costs ~4-8MiB of leaves.  Interior nodes
// and leaves are allocated on demand on the WRITER path only (which already
// holds the lookup-cache write lock) and are never freed while the owning
// GuestToHostMap lives -- ClearAll() zeroes the words instead of freeing, so a
// concurrent lock-free reader can never chase a dangling node.  Everything is
// released in the destructor, i.e. when the CodeBuffer dies.
//
// MAINTENANCE POINTS (all under GuestToHostMap's write lock)
// ----------------------------------------------------------
//   SET   GuestToHostMap::AddBlockExecutableRange  -- the single choke point
//         through which a guest page becomes a "code page", reached from
//         Core.cpp CompileBlock (fresh compile), Core.cpp
//         TryRelinkSoftInvalidatedBlock (SMC v3 relink) and CodeCache.cpp
//         LoadCacheFile (cache-loaded blocks).  Callers that know the block's
//         decoded guest extent pass it and get granule precision; callers that
//         do not (cache load, custom IR, GuestRangeLength==0) pass nothing and
//         get a conservative all-64-bits-set page.
//   CLEAR GuestToHostMap::InvalidateRange, GuestToHostMap::SoftInvalidateRange
//         -- both already clear the CodePages entries for whole pages, so the
//         leaves for those pages are zeroed in the same place.  Per-BLOCK bit
//         clearing is deliberately NOT attempted: several blocks share a
//         granule, so subtracting one block's bits could clear another's.
//         Page-level clear plus re-set on the next compile/relink is correct.
//   CLEAR GuestToHostMap::InvalidateRangePrecise (SMCChecks=icache) -- the one
//         path that erases SOME of a page's blocks and keeps the rest. It does
//         not subtract the erased blocks' bits; it RECOMPUTES the page's word
//         as the union of what the surviving blocks need, which is exact. See
//         RecomputePageWord below and Interface/Core/SMCICache.h.
//   CLEAR GuestToHostMap::ClearCache -- BlockList is emptied there (CodeBuffer
//         swap / ClearCodeCache), so every bit must go.
//

  // True IFF the bitmap can prove that no compiled block's guest bytes lie in
  // [Start, Start+Length). False means "overlaps, OR we do not know" and the
  // caller MUST fall through to the authoritative locked query.
  //
  // ===================== MEMORY-ORDERING SOUNDNESS =====================
  // The dangerous outcome is a reader that observes a stale CLEAR bit for
  // bytes that are (becoming) live code and, on the strength of it, pwrites
  // through /proc/self/mem into them -- silent guest corruption, because the
  // page stays protected and no block is invalidated.  Three facts make that
  // impossible, none of which depend on this structure's own ordering being
  // stronger than relaxed:
  //
  // (1) A reader only exists downstream of a WRITE FAULT on a guest page that
  //     mtrack has write-protected.  Protection is armed by
  //     SyscallHandler::MarkGuestExecutableRange, and Core.cpp CompileBlock and
  //     TryRelinkSoftInvalidatedBlock both call it AFTER
  //     LookupCache::AddBlockExecutableRange -- which is where the bits are
  //     set.  So for any page whose protection can produce a fault, the
  //     bit-SET for the block that caused the protection happened-before the
  //     mprotect(2) that armed it.  mprotect is a kernel-side full barrier
  //     with a TLB shootdown IPI to every CPU, and the faulting thread reaches
  //     the reader through a kernel entry/exit of its own; the SET is
  //     therefore globally visible before any fault the protection can raise.
  //     This is why the bits must be set at AddBlockExecutableRange and not,
  //     say, at AddBlockMapping.
  //
  // (2) The residual window is a SECOND block being compiled onto an ALREADY
  //     protected page: its bits are set while another thread is faulting on
  //     the same page.  The bitmap read is no weaker than the path it
  //     replaces.  Today's reader takes the lookup read lock and calls
  //     GuestToHostMap::RangeOverlapsCompiledCode, which walks CodePages and
  //     skips ("continue") every entry not yet present in BlockList.  Between
  //     AddBlockExecutableRange and AddBlockMapping -- exactly the window in
  //     question -- the new block IS in CodePages but is NOT in BlockList, so
  //     the current authoritative query already returns "no overlap" and the
  //     current code already pwrites into the bytes being compiled.  The
  //     bitmap's SET happens at the START of that window rather than at its
  //     end, so any reader that would have been told "clear" by the bitmap
  //     would have been told "clear" by the existing path too, and some are
  //     now correctly told "set".  Strictly stronger, never weaker.
  //
  // (3) Every CLEAR is page-granular and happens under the same write lock
  //     while the corresponding blocks are being erased from BlockList, and
  //     all of hard invalidate / soft invalidate / ClearCache hold
  //     ContextImpl::CodeInvalidationMutex EXCLUSIVELY, whereas CompileBlock
  //     holds it SHARED.  Compile and invalidate can therefore never
  //     interleave, so a SET can never be lost to a concurrent page CLEAR.
  //
  // Given (1)-(3) the loads below only need to be atomic (no tearing) and to
  // carry the dependency from a node pointer to the node's contents; they are
  // acquire on the pointers and relaxed on the word.  A stale-SET bit costs a
  // wasted fallback; a stale-CLEAR bit is excluded by (1)/(2).
